I'm making a todo program I guess.

The ulterior motive for this project has also become a fun way to help myself
learn vim.

## Goals
I want to make a program that I would actually use for todos.
- It can be running on a terminal in the background
- I can tag and filter different items
- I can have more extensive notes

## Tasks
I am painfully aware of using this system for todoes as I build a todos system.
- Refactor to be consistent with use of word slice.
    - User (config) -many-> Slice -many-> Notes
- Move notes to a notes directory path that the user can set in config
- Creating new notes menu option
- More explicit notes datatype that I can read/write from files
