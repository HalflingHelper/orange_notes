I'm making a todo program I guess.

The ulterior motive for this project has also become a fun way to help myself
learn vim.

## Goals
I want to make a program that I would actually use for todos.
- It can be running on a terminal in the background
- I can tag and filter different items
- I can have more extensive notes

### Stretch
- Repeating items, i.e. for setting up a calendar

## Tasks
I am painfully aware of using this system for todoes as I build a todos system.
- More comprehensive config support: saving, datatype?
- Move notes to an optional notes directory path that the user can set in config
- Reading and writing slices from files
- Creating new notes menu option
